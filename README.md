# Yaz Khoury Portfolio Site

### Description

This repository contains the code for generating my portfolio website layout.
It has included modals and portfolio descriptions and photographs that can be edited
by the user in anyway they want to suit their needs.

Furthermore, you have an extra about.html file for your "About-Me" page if you like
to include descriptions about your background. It has already been pre-filled by me,
so edit it however you see fit.

A Gruntfile.js has been included to generate separate copies of images, depending on
pixel density of the screen, which will be determined by the browser. You don't need to use
my photos for your project, but if you are using large images, consider using the Gruntfile.js
to trim down the images. Example of using the image sizes can be seen in the <img srcset="...">
attribute in the html files. For more information on how to use Gruntfile.js,
